In this project,I have provided with a California dataset to answer the following questions. Before starting the project, I explored the dataset online also. All these questions are mandatory. I gave an introduction of the project first. I also put comments after codes to explain the step.I explained each result after getting the result and figures. I also explained which feature is nominal, ordinal, discrete or continuous.   




I addressed following questions leveraging advance Python, utilizing libraries like Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib and Seaborn and High order functions like Lambda :



1. What is the average median income of the data set and check the distribution of data using appropriate plots. Please explain the distribution of the plot.



2. Draw an appropriate plot to see the distribution of housing_median_age and explain your observations.



3. Show with the help of visualization, how median_income and median_house_values are related?



4. Create a data set by deleting the corresponding examples from the data set for which total_bedrooms are not available.



5. Create a data set by filling the missing data with the mean value of the total_bedrooms in the original data set.



6. Write a programming construct (create a user defined function) to calculate the median value of the data set wherever required.



7. Plot latitude versus longitude and explain your observations.



8. Create a data set for which the ocean_proximity is ‘Near ocean’.



9. Find the mean and median of the median income for the data set created in question 8.



10. Please create a new column named total_bedroom_size. If the total bedrooms is 10 or less, it should be quoted as small. If the total bedrooms is 11 or more but less than 1000, it should be medium, otherwise it should be considered large.
